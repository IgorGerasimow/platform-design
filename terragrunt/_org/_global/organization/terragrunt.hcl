  # OU hierarchy. Issue #158 calls for the canonical 5-OU split:
  #   Production / Non-Production / Deployments / Suspended / Sandbox.
  # We keep our existing OU names (Security, Infrastructure, Workloads,
  # NonProd, Prod) for backwards compatibility with already-deployed SCPs
  # and SSO permission-set assignments — see docs/ou-structure.md for the
  # mapping. New OUs (Deployments, Sandbox) are added top-level. Suspended
  # is created as a hard-coded top-level OU inside the organization module.
  #
  # Aliases (this repo -> canonical name):
  #   Prod        -> Production

  #   Deployments -> Deployments     (new)
