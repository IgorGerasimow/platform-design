# Tech Stack

This document outlines the technologies used for the casino platform. The solution blends AWS services with bare metal nodes to host blockchain components and provides a Kubernetes-based runtime for workloads written primarily in Go.

## Infrastructure & DevOps

- **AWS** – EKS for Kubernetes clusters, EC2 for compute, RDS for managed PostgreSQL, S3 for object storage, and CloudWatch for logging and metrics.
- **Bare Metal Servers** – dedicated nodes for running internal blockchain and high-performance workloads.
- **Kubernetes** – cluster orchestration using Helm charts and Kustomize overlays.
- **Terraform** – IaC for provisioning cloud and on-prem resources.
- **ArgoCD** – GitOps deployment management for Kubernetes manifests.
- **Cloudflare** – DNS management, CDN, and edge security.
- **GitHub Actions** – CI/CD pipelines.
- **Docker** – container packaging for services.
- **Helm** – package manager for Kubernetes applications.
- **Kustomize** – configuration overlays for various environments.

Additional tools include Prometheus and Grafana for observability, Loki or Elasticsearch for log aggregation, HashiCorp Vault for secrets management, and optional service mesh technologies like Istio or Linkerd.

## Data Stores

- **PostgreSQL** – primary relational store.
- **MongoDB** – document database for flexible schemas.
- **Kafka** – message streaming and event distribution.
- **Redis** – in-memory caching and ephemeral data.

## Languages & Frameworks

- **Golang** – main language for backend services and blockchain modules.
- **Node.js** – used for supporting tooling or lightweight web frontends.
- **Swagger/OpenAPI** – API documentation and client generation.

This stack is designed to support a modern cloud-native casino platform with the scalability and reliability required for gaming workloads while integrating a private blockchain for internal transactions.
